## CAAAAN DO!

React project focusing on fetching content from a external API, implementing pagination
and infinite scrolling with a fancy design. Uses the Rick & Morty API for the data (https://rickandmortyapi.com/)

## To run the application:

- You need Node.js and npm installed (latest versions preferred)
- Clone the repository and be sure to be on the "development" branch
- Navigate to the react-and-morty directory
- Run `npm ci` in the terminal to install dependencies
- Run `npm start` to start it
- Once its running it will automatically open the app in a browser, you can also reach it on localhost:3000, if you want to change the port you can do so by creating a .env.local file, and writing PORT={port_you_want} into it before starting
