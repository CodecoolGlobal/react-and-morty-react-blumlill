CAAAAN DO!

React project focusing on fetching content from a external API, implementing pagination
and infinite scrolling with a fancy design. 

-------------

To run the application:

- you need node and npm installed (latest versions preferred)
- clone the repository and be sure to be on "development" branch
- in the repository root run ```npm ci``` in the terminal
- then run 
```npm start``` 
- once react started it will automatically open the app in a browser, you can also reach it on localhost:3000
